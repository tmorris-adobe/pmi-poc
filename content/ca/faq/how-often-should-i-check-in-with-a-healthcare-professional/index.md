# How often should I check in with a healthcare professional?

After using medical cannabis for a few months, it is generally advised to follow up with a healthcare professional to determine whether any changes are needed to dose, type of medical cannabis, etc.

Remember that your medical document is valid for only one year and you will need to request a new medical document before it expires.
