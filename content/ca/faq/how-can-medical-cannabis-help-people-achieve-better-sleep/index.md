The following is taken from the Government of Canada website: **[Information for Health Care Professionals: Cannabis (marihuana, marijuana) and the cannabinoids](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/information-medical-practitioners/information-health-care-professionals-cannabis-cannabinoids.html#a4.9.5.2)**

"Limited evidence from clinical studies suggests that certain cannabinoids (cannabis, nabilone, dronabinol, nabiximols) may improve sleep in patients with disturbances in sleep associated with certain chronic disease states.

"Clinical data: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 RCTs (N=2,454 participants) of cannabinoids (i.e., smoked cannabis, nabiximols, nabilone, dronabinol, CBD, THC, levonontradol, ajulemic acid) using the GRADE approach reported that there was some evidence that cannabinoids may improve sleep (insomnia, sleep quality, sleep disturbance)."
