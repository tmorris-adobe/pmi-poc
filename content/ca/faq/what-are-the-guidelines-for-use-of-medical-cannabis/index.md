# What are the guidelines for use of medical cannabis?

Because medical cannabis can be authorized for use for any medical condition, and dosing, frequency and duration of therapy vary for each medical condition, guidance on how to use medical cannabis in general practice is limited.

However, it is generally recommended to start with a low dose of medical cannabis and gradually increase the dose until the desired effect is achieved.
