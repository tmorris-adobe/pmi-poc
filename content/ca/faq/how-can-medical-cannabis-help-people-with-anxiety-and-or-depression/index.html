Indeed, increasing evidence suggests pure CBD, at doses of several hundred milligrams (i.e., 300-600 mg, p.o.) may be effective in decreasing acute, experimentally induced social anxiety in the clinic, although the extent to which CBD (at the relatively lower concentrations commonly found in THC-predominant cannabis) is able to achieve anxiolysis either in an experimental or, more importantly, in a real-life setting, remains uncertain."</p><p><a href="/ca/health-care-professionals/a-guide-for-hcps/">&#x3C; Go Back</a></p>
