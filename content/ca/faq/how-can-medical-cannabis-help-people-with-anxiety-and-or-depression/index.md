# How can medical cannabis help people with anxiety and/or depression?

The following is taken from the Government of Canada website: **[Information for Health Care Professionals: Cannabis (marihuana, marijuana) and the cannabinoids](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/information-medical-practitioners/information-health-care-professionals-cannabis-cannabinoids.html#a4.9.5.1)**

"Evidence from pre-clinical studies suggests that CBD exhibits anxiolytic effects in various animal models of anxiety, while limited evidence from clinical studies suggest CBD may have anxiolytic effects in an experimental model of social anxiety.

"Clinical data: At least 10 clinical studies have examined the acute anxiolytic properties of CBD. Indeed, increasing evidence suggests pure CBD, at doses of several hundred milligrams (i.e., 300-600 mg, p.o.) may be effective in decreasing acute, experimentally induced social anxiety in the clinic, although the extent to which CBD (at the relatively lower concentrations commonly found in THC-predominant cannabis) is able to achieve anxiolysis either in an experimental or, more importantly, in a real-life setting, remains uncertain."
