# How do I get medical cannabis in Canada?

First, you must know the law. To obtain medical cannabis, individuals must receive authorization from a healthcare professional. Individuals with a medical authorization to use medical cannabis can possess a maximum of 30 times the daily quantity of medical cannabis indicated in their medical document (maximum of 150g of dried cannabis).

Next, talk to a healthcare professional or seek a medical cannabis clinic. Healthcare professionals in Canada can authorize medical cannabis for medical purposes for any medical condition. You do not need to prove that other treatments have not been successful.

The medical authorization document you receive will include information about the daily dose and duration of medical cannabis use. Please note that the duration cannot exceed one year. Medical cannabis clinics may provide you with more information on access and how to proceed with the medical cannabis authorization document.

Once a medical document has been issued, you need to register with a licensed producer to access the different options available. You can have more than one medical document, but each document may only be registered with a single licensed producer.

Once registered, the licensed producer will contact you and provide you with more information on how to buy medical cannabis through their platforms.
