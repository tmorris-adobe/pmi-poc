# THC vs. CBD: what's the difference?

THC is the compound found in cannabis that gives the feeling of being high and euphoric. It interacts with various areas of the brain to alter emotional processing, cognition, the reward system, learning and memory, balance and appetite. It also interacts with other areas of the body to affect mechanisms associated with inflammation as well as the perception of pain.

CBD is a compound that, when used, does not lead to feelings of being high or euphoric. It is thought to provide anti-anxiety, anti-seizure, antipsychotic and neuroprotective effects in the brain.
