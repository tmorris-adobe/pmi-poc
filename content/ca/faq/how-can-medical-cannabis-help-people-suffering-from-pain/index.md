# How can medical cannabis help people suffering from pain

The following is taken from the Government of Canada website: **[Information for Health Care Professionals: Cannabis (marihuana, marijuana) and the cannabinoids](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/information-medical-practitioners/information-health-care-professionals-cannabis-cannabinoids.html#a4.7.1)**

"Acute pain: The results from clinical studies with smoked cannabis, oral THC, cannabis extract, and nabilone in experimentally induced acute pain in healthy human volunteers are limited and mixed and suggest a dose-dependent effect in some cases, with lower doses of THC having an analgesic effect and higher doses having a hyperalgesic effect.

"Chronic pain: Endocannabinoids, THC, CBD, nabilone and certain synthetic cannabinoids have all been identified as having an anti-nociceptive effect in animal models of chronic pain (inflammatory and neuropathic)."

"Neuropathic pain and chronic non-cancer pain in humans: A few studies that have used experimental methods having predictive validity for pharmacotherapies used to alleviate chronic pain have reported an analgesic effect of smoked cannabis. Furthermore, there is more consistent evidence of the efficacy of cannabinoids (smoked/vapourized cannabis, nabiximols, dronabinol) in treating chronic pain of various etiologies, especially in cases where conventional treatments have been tried and have failed."
