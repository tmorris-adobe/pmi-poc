Furthermore, there is more consistent evidence of the efficacy of cannabinoids (smoked/vapourized cannabis, nabiximols, dronabinol) in treating chronic pain of various etiologies, especially in cases where conventional treatments have been tried and have failed."</p><p><a href="/ca/health-care-professionals/a-guide-for-hcps/">&#x3C; Go Back</a></p>
