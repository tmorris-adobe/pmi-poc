# How to authorize medical cannabis in Canada

HCPs in Canada can authorize medical cannabis for medical purposes for any medical condition without the need to document failure of conventional therapies. HCPs must authorize patients with a medical document for medical cannabis that specifies daily dose and duration of use (cannot exceed one year).

Patients must take their medical document and register with a licensed producer. They may also have more than one medical document -- and each document may only be registered with a single licensed producer.

Patients with medical authorization to use medical cannabis can possess a maximum of 30 times the daily quantity of medical cannabis indicated in their medical document (maximum of 150 g of dried cannabis).
