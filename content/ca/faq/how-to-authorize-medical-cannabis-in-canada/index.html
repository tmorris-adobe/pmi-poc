HCPs must authorize patients with a medical document for medical cannabis that specifies daily dose and duration of use (cannot exceed one year).</p><p>Patients must take their medical document and register with a licensed producer. They may also have more than one medical document -- and each document may only be registered with a single licensed producer.</p><p>Patients with medical authorization to use medical cannabis can possess a maximum of 30 times the daily quantity of medical cannabis indicated in their medical document (maximum of 150 g of dried cannabis).</p><p><a href="/ca/health-care-professionals/a-guide-for-hcps/">&#x3C; Go Back</a></p>
