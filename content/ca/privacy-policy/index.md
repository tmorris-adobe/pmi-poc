Information that we collect from third parties will generally consist of publicly available information.

#### For what purposes do we use information about you, and on what legal basis?

In this section, we describe the purposes for which we use personal information. However, this is a global notice, and where the laws of a country restrict or prohibit certain activities described in this notice, we will not use information about you for those purposes in that country.

Subject to the above, we use information about you for the following purposes:

- To comply with regulatory obligations
- To provide product information services to you, including dealing with your inquiries and requests
- For other purposes that we notify you of, or will be clear from the context, at the point information about you is first collected

The legal basis for our use of information about you is one of the following:

- compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject;
- a legitimate business interest that is not overridden by interests you have to protect the information;

where none of the above applies, or where law requires it, your consent (which we will ask for before we process the information).

Where we do not base our use of information about you on one of the above legal bases, or where law requires it, we will ask for your consent before we process the information (these cases will be clear from the context).

In some instances, we may use information about you in ways that are not described above. Where this is the case, we will provide a supplemental privacy notice that explains such use. You should read any supplemental notice in conjunction with this notice.

#### Who do we share your information with, and for what purposes?

We may share information about you with:

- Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliates;
- third parties who provide Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliates or you with products or services;
- Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliates' carefully selected business partners and advertisers (in areas connected with our products, or consistent with their style and image) so that they can contact you with offers that they think may interest you, in accordance with your preferences; and
- other third parties, where required or permitted by law.

We share information about you with others only in accordance with applicable laws. Thus, where law requires your consent, we will first ask for it.

- Information about you will be shared with Philip Morris Products S.A. (based in Neuchâtel, Switzerland), which is the place of central administration of personal data processing for Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliates. Philip Morris Products S.A. processes the information about you for all the purposes described in this notice.

- Information about you may be shared with any other Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliate that you contact (for example information on Vectura Fertin Pharma products) in order to enhance our service to you.

Details of Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliates and the countries in which they are established are available via our website.

Sharing data with Third Parties

- To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may share information about you with third parties who provide Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliates or you with products or services (such as advisers and information services providers).
- To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may share information about you with Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliates' carefully selected third party business partners and advertisers (in line with the kind of thing you might associate with our products, for example because they have similar or complementary image, style, or functionality)
- We may share information about you with other third parties, where required or permitted by law, for example: regulatory authorities; government departments; in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials; when we consider disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; and in the context of organisational restructuring.

Country-specific additional points

According to which country you are in, we want you to be aware of some further points.

#### Where might information about you be sent?

As with any multinational organisation, we transfer information globally to our affiliates and service providers. Your data may therefore be transferred to other countries as part of our standard operations. Whenever we transfer your data abroad, we will limit access to your data only to those who need to see it, process your data in accordance with our internal data protection standards, protect it appropriately and only transfer information in compliance with applicable data privacy laws. When data is transferred, we will require the receiving party to keep your data confidential, delete it when it is no longer required and act in accordance with this privacy notice. Accordingly, information about you may be transferred outside of your jurisdiction. For example, if you live in the EU, EEA, UK, Australia or Japan, your data may be processed in another country.

When using information as described in this notice, information about you may be transferred either within or outside the country or territory where it was collected, including to a country or territory that may not have equivalent data protection standards.

For example, we and other Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliates within the EU and EEA may transfer personal information to Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliates, or to their service providers, outside the EU and EEA. In all such cases, the transfer will be:

- on the basis of a European Commission adequacy decision;
- subject to appropriate safeguards, for example the EU Standard Contractual Clauses or binding corporate rules; or
- with your consent or as necessary to discharge obligations under a contract between you and us (or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request) or for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest between us and a third party, such as in relation to travel arrangements.

For transfers from the UK, in accordance with the UK GDPR and guidance of the Information Commissioner's Office.

In all cases, appropriate security measures for the protection of personal information will be applied in those countries or territories, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Our service providers are located in many countries throughout the world, including in particular the EEA, Switzerland, the USA, Canada, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia.

#### How do we protect information about you?

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal information that we hold from unauthorised disclosure, use, alteration or destruction. Where appropriate, we use encryption and other technologies that can assist in securing the information you provide. We also require our service providers to comply with strict data privacy and security requirements.

#### How long will information about you be kept?

We will retain information about you for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected in accordance with our internal data retention standards. After that, we will delete it. The period will vary depending on the purposes for which the information was collected. Note that in some circumstances, you have the right to request us to delete the information. Also, we are sometimes subject to legal obligations, legally obliged to retain the information, for example, for tax and accounting purposes, to either retain the information for a set minimum period of time, or to delete it after a set maximum period of time.

Typically, we retain data based on the criteria described in the table below. Where these periods conflict with legal obligations, for example, for tax and accounting purposes, to either retain the information for a set minimum period of time, or to delete it after a set maximum period of time, we apply those set periods instead.

#### What rights and options do you have?

You may have some or all of the following rights in respect of information about you that we hold:

- request us to give you access to it;
- request us to rectify it, update it, or erase it;
- request us to restrict our using it, in certain circumstances;
- object to our using it, in certain circumstances;
- withdraw your consent to our using it;
- data portability, in certain circumstances;
- opt out from our using it for direct marketing; and
- lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in your country (if there is one).

We offer you easy ways to exercise these rights, such as "unsubscribe" links, or giving you a contact address, in messages you receive.

Some mobile applications we offer might also send you push messages, for instance about new products or services. You can disable these messages through the settings in your phone or the application.

The rights you have depend on the laws of your country. If you are in the UK, European Union, European Economic Area, you will have the rights set out in the table below. If you are elsewhere, you can contact us (see the paragraph "who should you contact with questions?" at the end of this notice) to find out more.

#### Who should you contact with questions?

If you have any questions, or wish to exercise any of your rights, you can find contact details for the relevant Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliate, and if applicable data protection officer, linked to at the top of this notice. Contact details will also be given in any communications that a Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliate sends you.

If your country has a data protection authority, you have a right to contact it with any questions or concerns. If the relevant Vectura Fertin Pharma affiliate cannot resolve your questions or concerns, you may also have the right to seek judicial remedy before a national court.

#### Changes to this notice

We may update this notice (and any supplemental privacy notice), from time to time. Where the law requires it, we will notify you of the changes; further, where the law requires it, we will also obtain your consent to the changes.
